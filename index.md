  ## Sara Fridovich-Keil
  I am a postdoc at Stanford University, working with Profs. Gordon Wetzstein and Mert Pilanci in the Department of Electrical Engineering. My research involves machine learning, signal processing, and optimization for solving inverse problems in computer vision as well as medical and scientific imaging.

Hi there! I am a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, where I work with [Gordon Wetzstein](https://web.stanford.edu/~gordonwz/) and [Mert Pilanci](https://web.stanford.edu/~pilanci/) on foundations and applications of machine learning and signal processing in computational imaging. I am currently supported by an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. I completed my PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley in May 2023, where I was advised by [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/) and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Outside of research, I like to hike, garden, cook, paint, and read fantasy and historical fiction novels.

### Contact info

The best way to reach me is by email, at `sarafk at stanford dot edu`. 

## Research interests

I am generally interested in foundations of machine learning, particularly connections to signal processing and optimization, and applications to inverse problems that arise in computer vision and computational, medical, and scientific imaging. Please have a look at my [PhD dissertation](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2023/EECS-2023-63.html) and/or [dissertation talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PpJx7MZiiNXr8X5sZCkmnQcJIiwvPc9Q/view). Some of my current research interests are:

* Finding the "right" signal representation for solving inverse problems, balancing interpretability and expressivity with computational constraints
* Bridging theory and practice for inverse problems, e.g. nonlinear compressive sensing
* Finding the "right" priors for solving inverse problems, e.g. how to leverage data-driven priors without succumbing to distribution shift fragility
* Applications to medical and scientific imaging, including MRI, CT, and cryo-EM

<!-- ## Lab

My lab website can be found [here](https://clearoboticslab.github.io). If you are a _prospective graduate student_, please feel free to reach out to me by email to express your interest. In your note, please identify one recent publication from the lab that you find interesting, and explain the technical nugget you found most exciting. Please also mention your favorite math class and the most exciting topic you learned in that class.

If you are an _undergraduate student_ who is interested in doing research in the lab, e.g. for a summer internship, please first reach out to students or postdocs in the lab and try to identify a potential mentor. Once you have identified a potential mentor, please email David and cc that mentor.

## Updates

Note that this website is not updated as regularly as my lab website above. Apologies for any confusion. -->

<!-- _(July 2021)_ I recently gave an invited talk at the [RSS 2021 Workshop on Perception and Control for Autonomous Navigation in Crowded, Dynamic Environments](https://negarmehr.github.io/RSS2021Workshop/). The talk aims to deliver a brief tutorial on (a) what dynamic games are, (b) why they are a good model for multi-agent interactions, (c) how to solve them efficiently, and (d) some of the mathematical subtlety underlying dynamic games. If you check out the earlier recorded talks in the workshop, you'll also notice that the iterative method for solving dynamic Nash games developed in my PhD thesis bears a striking resemblance to contemporaneous, [independent work going on at Waymo Research](https://youtu.be/T_LkNm3oXdE?t=640). -->
